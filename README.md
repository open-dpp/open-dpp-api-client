# Description

This repository contains a HTTP client for the REST API of our open-dpp platform.

# Usage Guide

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install @open-dpp/api-client
```

## Usage

Create a new instance of a client with the baseURL parameter directing to your API.

```typescript
const apiClient = new OpenDppApiClient({baseURL: API_URL});
```

Set the ApiKey for the client to enable it to authenticate to your API.

```typescript
apiClient.setApiKey(token);
```

Use any function of the client. E.g., create an organization.

```typescript
const addOrganization = async () => {
   console.log('Creating organization...');
   const response = await apiClient.postOrganization({
      name: "Test",
   });
   console.log('Finished creating an organization.');
   if (response.status === 201) {
      console.log("Successfully created an organization.");
   } else {
      console.error("Error on creating an organization.");
   }
};
```

# Development Guide

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Deployment

1. Commit your current changed files for a clean working tree in the next step
2. Merge your changes on the main branch
3. Run ```npm run build``` to see if your code compiles
4. Run ```npm run test``` to see if your code fails
5. Determine whether you want to create a patch, minor or major version. Run the fitting npm scripts (e.g., npm run
   patch)
   1. This updates the version number in the package.json
   2. Also, a git tag is created for the version
   3. The git tag and current branch are pushed to GitHub
   4. First, the push triggers a workflow to create a new release in GitHub
   5. Finishing that workflow triggers another one to publish the release to npm
